    "# Lab 07 - Social Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Social network analysis is a type of analysis which interprets, analyzes, and visualises *relational* data. Instead of beginning from the person or tweet as the unit of analysis, with social network analysis (or SNA) we begin from the relationship between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The building blocks of a network are *nodes* and *edges*. Nodes represent individuals in the network. They are people, tweets, firms, Twitter users, etc. They are the thing doing the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/net-1-node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between nodes are called *edges*. They imply some kind of relationship between the edges. This interaction could be friendship, mutual attendance of an event, dating, or has done business with.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/net-1-edge.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges can be *directed* or *undirected*. For instance, on Facebook, friendships are mutual and both parties must agree to that friendship. Therefore, it is called *undirected* because it is by definition a two-way relationship. However, on Twitter, user A can follow user B, but user B does not have to follow user A. This is called a *directed* graph because it can be a one-way relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, edges can be *weighted*. Weights are usually numerical values which indicate a strength of a relationship. The edge between you and your best friend is probably higher than you and one of your classmates who you do not speak to often."

    "In this lab we will be using a small network that indicates [interactions in the movie Star Wars Episode IV](http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/). Here, each node is a character and each edge indicates whether they appeared together in a scene of the movie. Edges here are thus undirected and they also have weights attached, since they can appear in multiple scenes together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to read the list of edges in this network. For this exercise, we are going to use the <code>[networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)</code> module to read, analyse, and visualise the networks. "
